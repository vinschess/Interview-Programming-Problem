## Interview Programming Problems

This repository contains all programming problems those haven been asked during interview from various top tech companies.

In this, I provide a problem statement along with companies name in which the problem has been asked and a test_cases.txt file which contains some test cases. I will add new test cases time to time.

These problem statements have been solved in following programming languages:
1. Python
2. Go
3. Python

**_Note :_** You are welcome to add and modify in the repository as well. Also if you have any problem statement and that you want to solve in any of the above programming language please let me know as well. I would love to solve those problems.
